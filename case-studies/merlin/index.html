         <h3>The Challenge</h3>
         <p>
            When I joined Digital Health R&D, the work to consolidate six discrete study design and planning tools was already underway. These tools were deeply embedded in AstraZeneca's governance process, delivering millions in annual benefits.
         </p>
         <p>
            Consolidation was strategically aimed to reduce cost to serve, remove user friction, and leverage the benefits of centralisation: unified data governance and analytics, holistic optimisation, and serving up- and downstream use cases from one study blueprint.
         </p>
         <p>
            Work was technically advanced but lacked UX vision and rigour. There was no clarity on user win conditions or plan to resolve functional redundancies. The team was heading into trouble.
         </p>   
         <p>
            As design lead, I acted fast to help the team replan, regroup, listen to users, and set up for successful delivery.
         </p>

         <h3>My Approach</h3>
         <p>
            I started by reorganising the UX team to shift focus from lengthy UI hand-offs to concept validation where key product bets remained untested. We had talented full-stack UXers pigeon-holed to narrow roles, wasting their potential. 
         </p>
         <p>
            So I asked them to take ownership of the entire design process: discovery to delivery. I paired greater responsibility with coaching and peer feedback to empower autonomy and influence in squads.
         </p>

            In parallel, I expedited concept validation to ensure value delivery. I led cross-functional prototyping of the end-to-end unified workflow and tested it with users. We confirmed the need for a single tool and learnt that:
         </p>
         <ul>
            <li>users want to enter study inputs only once</li>
            <li>users expect data to sync across all product parts</li>
            <li>redundant features degrade workflow and data integrity</li>
            <li>user trust depends on system consistency</li>
         </ul>
         <p>
            To cross-reference qualitative insights with quantitative data, I led an initiative to set up user analytics, segment user populations, track meaningful metrics, and foster data-driven development.

         <h3>The Solution</h3>
         <p>
            The team delivered Merlin, consolidating six tools together into one study optimisation workflow:
         </p>
         <ul>
            <li>Study Designer — digitises clinical study design</li>
            <li>Cost Estimator — estimate study cost in 4 minutes</li>
            <li>Feasibility — recommends sites to meet recruitment goals</li>
            <li>Carbon Emissions — calculates CO<sub>2</sub> emitted by studies</li>
            <li>Patient Experience — measure patient burden</li>
            <li>Complexity Tool — evaluates study design complexity</li>
         </ul>
         <p>
            Merlin uses a single codebase and a design system for consistent experience. It supports all prior use cases plus new ones allowing users to generate study options and make holistic multi-factor comparisons that inform business decision making.

         <h3>The Result</h3>
         <p>
            Merlin launched in October 2023 and replaced all six consolidated workflows. 100% of users successfully migrated to the new app (tracked in analytics).
         </p>
         <p>
            We baselined Merlin's <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/service/customer-satisfaction-score" target="_blank>">CSAT</a> and <a href="https://measuringu.com/umux-lite/" target="_blank">UMUX-Lite</a> scores on launch. Over the next year I drove product refinements that lifted CSAT by 192%. 
         </p>
         <p>
            In parallel, I transformed the UX team from a UI production unit to an influential partner driving concept and validation of high-value product bets, boosting performance by 340%.
