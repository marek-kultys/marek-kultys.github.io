         <h3>The Challenge</h3>
         <p>
            When I joined Digital Health R&D, the work to consolidate six discrete study design and planning tools was already underway. These tools were deeply embedded in AstraZeneca's governance process, delivering millions in annual benefits.
         </p>
         <p>
            Consolidation was strategically aimed to reduce cost to serve, remove user friction, and leverage the benefits of centralisation: unified data governance and analytics, holistic optimisation, and serving up- and downstream use cases from one study blueprint.
         </p>
         <p>
            Works were technically advanced but lacked UX vision and rigour. There was no clarity on user win conditions and no plan to resolve functional redundancies. The team was heading into trouble.
         </p>   
         <p>
            As design lead, I acted fast to help the team replan, regroup, listen to the user, and set up for successful delivery.
         </p>

         <h3>My Approach</h3>
         <p>
            I started by reorganising the UX team to shift focus from lengthy UI hand-offs to concept validation where key product bets remained untested. We had some talented full-stack UXers but they were pigeon-holed to narrow roles, wasting their potential. 
         </p>
         <p>
            So I asked them to take ownership of the entire design process: discovery to delivery. I paired greater responsibility with coaching and peer feedback to empower autonomy and influence in squads.
         </p>

               I introduced changes to UX process and scope that brought a 3× performance boost to the UX team, evidenced by the improved burndown rate from Feb 2023 to June 2024 (tasks completed within individual 3-week sprints).

         <p>
            In parallel, I expedited concept validation to ensure we're delivering value. I led cross-functional prototyping of the end-to-end unified workflow and tested it with users. We confirmed the need for a single tool and learnt that:
         </p>
         <ul>
            <li>users want to enter study inputs only once</li>
            <li>users expect data to sync across all parts of the product</li>
            <li>redundant features degrade workflow and data integrity</li>
            <li>user trust depends on the perceived system consistency</li>
         </ul>
         <p>
            To cross-reference these qual insights with quant data, I led an initiative to set up user analytics, segment user populations, and foster a culture of data-driven development. Our first analytics platform was Matomo but we later moved to Fullstory.

         <h3>The Solution</h3>
         <p>
            The team delivered a consolidated product called Merlin that brought six tools together into one study optimisation workflow:
         </p>
         <ul>
            <li>Study Designer — to digitise the design of a clinical trial</li>
            <li>Cost Estimator — to estimate the cost of a trial in 4 minutes</li>
            <li>Feasibility — to recommend sites to meet recruitment goals</li>
            <li>Carbon Emissions — to calculate CO<sub>2</sub> emitted by the study</li>
            <li>Patient Experience — to measure the burden on the patient</li>
            <li>Complexity Tool — to evaluate the complexity of study design</li>
         </ul>
         <p>
            Merlin uses a single codebase and a design system for consistent look and feel. It supports all prior use cases and new ones that allow users to generate study options and make comprehensive multi-factor comparisons that inform business decision making.

               By bringing together multiple tools into one workflow, Merlin users can better control all clinical study metrics when optimising study design.

               For example, users can keep an eye on the rising total cost as they add sites to accelerate study recruitment.

         <h3>The Result</h3>
         <p>
            Merlin was launched in October 2023 and quickly replaced all six workflows that it consolidated. 100% of users successfully migrated to the new app (evidenced in user analytics).
         </p>
         <p>
            On launch, we baselined Merlin's CSAT (customer satisfaction) and UMUX-Lite scores (usability and utility). Over the next year, I drove product refinements that lifted our CSAT result up by 192%. 
         </p>
         <p>
            In parallel, I transformed the UX team from an UI production unit to an influential partner driving concept and validation of high-value product bets, boosting our performance by 340%.
