         <h3>The Challenge</h3>
         <p>
            Cost Estimator, Merlin, Feasibility Optimiser and Protocol Complexity Tool have already been successful at AstraZeneca serving discrete use cases in the clinical study optimisation workflow. Merlin alone delivered hundreds of millions USD of annual benefits through detailed cost estimation of clinical trials.
         </p>
         <p>
            Product leadership decided to consolidate the four products into one to reduce product maintenance costs, reduce friction for users moving between tools, and leverage strategic opportunities associated with integration.
         </p>
         <p>
            When I joined, the product team was already planning the integration, but little thoughts was given to the end user experience and trust in the data-driven product. I saw the team sleep-walking into a disaster. On top of that, the UX team was disempowered to speak up and positively influence the direction. I had to act fast.
         </p>
         <h3>My Approach</h3>
         <p>
            I started by reorganising the UX team to shift its focus from lenghty UI hand-offs and delivery testing to concept-making and validation to reduce uncertainties around product integration. We had some talented full-stack UXers on the team, but the organisation was not using their talents to the full potential.
         </p>
         <p>
            I asked people to step up, gave them bigger responsibilities paired with one-to-one support, and empowered them to influence their squads autonomously but in line with our shared design vision for the product and shared design guidelines.
         </p>
         <p>
            I also transformed the way we managed design work. I centralised tracking of design work for all squads, aligned with all cross-functional workstreams, made the UX board visible to all stakeholders in the business (together with our performance metrics), and set up regular check-points with designers to manage the flow of delivery.
         </p>

            In parallel, I led a cross-functional collaboration with product to prototype the desired integration. Visualising the end result as a workflow from the user-perspective (something the team has not done before) was eye-opening and led to many questions that had to be tested with users.
         </p>
         <p>
            I led corresponding user validation that confirmed user requirements for an integrated product experience:
         </p>
         <ul>
            <li>users expect to enter input only once</li>
            <li>users expect data to sync across parts of the product</li>
            <li>integrated workflow made some of the features redundant</li>
            <li>users' trust depends on the perceived system consistency</li>
         </ul>
