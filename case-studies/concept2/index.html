            <h3>The Challenge</h3>
            <p>
               It has been reported that only 40%â€“60% of COPD patients adhere to prescribed drug regimen, and only 1 out of 10 perform inhalation correctly (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2629978/">source</a>). Pharma companies aim to improve health outcomes by building digital tools to help with adherence and technique.
            </p>
            <p>
               In 2017, Novartis needed a design for a new patient-facing app that paired with a smart inhaler, tracked medication adherence, sent reminders, and coached COPD patients. A phase III study was to evaluate rhe benefits of this digital intervention. For onboarding, a new training experience was needed to train study participants in pairing of the inhaler and taking the inhalations correctly.

         <h3>The Solution</h3>
         <p>
            As part of a broader app development project, I led the design and production of an in-app video onboarding and training experience that prepared patients to use their digital inhaler in a clinical trial.

      <div class="container-two-thirds shift">
         <h3>My Approach</h3>
         <p>
            In the design stage, I storyboarded the video, prototyped and iterated inhalation sequences (tested on myself and team as patient proxies) and secured regulatory sign-offs.
         </p>
         <p>
            In production, I hired actors and directed filming, voiceover and foley recordings, editing, and post-production. I also managed translation and localisation into 7 languages.

         <h3>The Result</h3>
         <p>
            The video was used in the Novartis <a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03379233?term=NCT03379233&rank=1">NCT03379233</a> clinical trial that aimed to evaluate the effects of digital interventions on patient adherence and engagement.
         </p>
         <p>
            Patients were successfully onboarded and trained, but the trial was discontinued due to inhaler device malfunction.
