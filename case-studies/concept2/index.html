            <h3>The Challenge</h3>
            <p>
               It has been reported that only 40%â€“60% of COPD patients adhere to prescribed drug regimen, and only 1 out of 10 perform inhalation correctly (<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2629978/">source</a>). Pharma companies aim to improve health outcomes by developing digital tools that support better adherence and technique.
            </p>
            <p>
               In 2017, Novartis developed a smart inhaler called Concept2 that could detect the occurence and quality of inhallations. To pair with Concept2, a new patient-facing app was needed to track medication adherence, set routines, and coach COPD patients. A phase III study was planned to evaluate the benefits of Concept2.
            </p>
            <p>
               My role was to design a new experience to train study participants in the correct technique of inhallation, and to help sustain it.

               Traditional training came in the form of a printed comic strip. Lots of room for user error, as well as opportunity for improvement through digitisation.

         <h3>The Solution</h3>
         <p>
            For Concept2, we chose video over print because:
         </p>
         <ul>
            <li>Training can be integrated into in-app user onboarding</li>
            <li>Video represents time as a key quality of the correct inhalation technique</li>
            <li>When Concept2 detects decline in technique, it can prompt a tailored refresher</li>
         </ul>
         <p>
            As part of a broader app development project, I led the design and production of an in-app video onboarding and training experience that prepared patients to use their digital inhaler in a clinical trial.

         <h3>My Approach</h3>
         <p>
            In the design stage, I storyboarded the video, prototyped and iterated inhalation sequences (tested on myself and team as patient proxies) and secured regulatory sign-offs.
         </p>
         <p>
            For production, I hired actors and directed filming, voiceover and foley recordings, editing, and post-production. I also managed translation and localisation into 7 languages (Czech, Dutch, UK and US English, French, German, Korean).

         <h3>The Result</h3>
         <p>
            The video was used in the Novartis <a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03379233?term=NCT03379233&rank=1">NCT03379233</a> clinical trial that aimed to evaluate the effects of digital interventions on patient adherence and engagement.
         </p>
         <p>
            Patients were successfully onboarded and trained, but the trial was discontinued due to an inhaler device malfunction.
