            <i>— Please help me help my patients!</i>
         </p>
         <p>
            This plea from Barcelona's Sant Joan de Déu pediatric clinical trial site team in summer 2024 crystallised a global crisis: clinical trials are drowning in complexity. <a href="https://f.hubspotusercontent10.net/hubfs/9468915/TuftsCSDD_June2021/pdf/Rising+Protocol+Design+Complexity+is+Driving+Rapid+Growth+in+Clinical+Trial+Data+Volume++++++++++.pdf">Tufts research</a> revealed a staggering increase in the number of procedures per trial and patient, which puts unreasonable burden on patients and sites, stifling drug R&D.
         </p>
         <p>
            Why does this matter and what can be done about it?
         </p>
         <h3>The Root Cause</h3>
         <p>
            Our research has shown that trial designs suffers from unverified assumptions, sponsor decisions insulated from patient voice, gated governance processes, and copy-pasting from old protocols. 
         </p>
         <p>
            We heard about a paediatric study recruiting 8-year-olds with a schedule including a questionnaire about the use of alcohol and contraception — thoughtlessly copied from another protocol.
         </p>
         <p>
            A lot of that can be traced back to how people in big pharma work and how decisions are made, with limited data. Pharma sponsors' clinical development (ClinDev) and clinical operations (ClinOps) teams rarely collaborate during the critical early stages of study creation when design choices impact study complexity and feasibility the most, and when the cost to improve is still low.
         </p>
      </div>

               The way pharma companies set up their study teams and run the study design process exacerbates the problem.

            <h4 class="caption">
               Teams rely on structured handoffs between ClinDev and ClinOps. This kills collaboration which is critical for holistic optimisation in the early stages of study design, when most can be achieved.
            </h4>
         </div>
      </div>


      <div class="container-two-thirds shift">
         
         <p>
            So why care?
         </p>
         <p>
            Firstly, more demanding and burdening trials mean fewer patients can afford to benefit from new treatments — and those who have no choice are faced with a daunting experience. Secondly, over-complex trials are harder to run, more expensive and riskier due to delays and higher drop-out rates — and this means longer waits, higher cost of medicines for all of us, and ultimately fewer lives saved.
         </p>
         <h3>The Challenge</h3>
          <p>
            We need clinical trials that are simpler, more effective, and deliver better outcomes for patients, sites, sponsors, and society. And we know we can get there by helping study teams make good trial design decisions early on, when holistic optimisation is still possible and worthwhile.
         </p>
         <p>
            AstraZeneca launched its health-tech company, Evinova, on a mission to address this challenge. Earlier, I helped AZ build <a href="/case-studies/merlin">Merlin</a> — a precursor to solving this problem — but it was not market-ready due to high levels of tech debt and tailoring to AZ's processes and organisation.
         </p>
         <p>
            So it became a classic 0-to-1 challenge: develop a new product and launch to early adopters within a year. Build a value proposition for both ClinDev and ClinOps users that will foster collaboration and holistic early-stage optimisation that reduces trial complexity and burden. And do it all while detatching from a global corporation, facilitating multiple team reorgs, and driving AI adoption. 
         </p>
         <h3>My Approach</h3>
         <p>
            As part of the cross-functional product leadership team, I shaped product strategy, directed design and delivery, and measured the success of our solution, Study Design and Planning (SDP).
         </p>
         <p>
            My approach to designing the new solution was evidence-based, design-led, and iteration-driven, leveraging the latest AI tools that kept emerging during the project. 
         </p>
         <p>
            I began by formulating the SDP vision using situational storyboards and speculative product screens for internal alignment and external communication. We centred our value proposition on enabling team collaboration and early-stage study optimisation.

            Through our research, we learnt that:
         </p>
         <ul>
            <li>Sponsor teams want to reduce protocol complexity but they need a reliable way to measure it.</li>
            <li>ClinDev teams copy-paste parts of old protocols to reduce regulatory risk, not to save time drafting the protocol.</li>
            <li>ClinDev-ClinOps collaboration tools depend on upstream adoption; to buy in, ClinDev teams must get immediate personal value from the tool (e.g. patient burden metrics, company-vetted templates, endpoint-assessment linking).</li>
            <li>Pharma can gain efficiency by streamlining decision-making, expediting feedback, and compressing governance processes (e.g. by maximising iteration cycles prior to review boards).</li>
         </ul>
         <p>
            <!-- Collaboration between ClinDev and ClinOps does not work because ClinDev start their work in MS Office tools and in unstructures documents because its easy for them and flexible (MS Office impose no constraints) but then when when handoff to ClinOps, ClinOps struggle with unstructured artefacts from Word and Excel because there is no way to easily calculate metrics for things that are unstructured, and ClinOps need to generate proxies to calculate cost and duration, and because of that their metrics become detatched from the design and when design changes, they need to update metrics manually and its just a very inefficient and frustrating process where there is high risk of human error. If ClinDev agreed to start working in the same tool where ClinOps will calculate their metrics, the problem will go away - there won't be a need to calculate metrics using inaccurate proxies and all metrics will be linked to the design, updating together with the design changes. But the challenge is so get ClinDev to use the design tools which offer less flexibility but for the better long-term benefit for ClinOps and ClinDev. And we learnt that the way to incentivise ClinDev to use the structured design tools was to offer them the metrics that they care about when designing the study in the tool (such as Patient Burden scores) or features that help make better choices about the assessments they use (e.g. company-vetted templates, assessments linked to selected endpoints) or features that reduce risk (e.g. flagging assessments that are not linked to endpoints or flagging when study arms have undesirable discrepancies). -->

            I spearheaded requirement gathering, design, and implementation of key clinical documents that form the backbone of a digital study protocol: Schedule of Activities (SoA), Eligibility Criteria, Study Schema, Objectives and Endpoints. These components enable structured study design aligned to <a href="https://www.cdisc.org/ddf">industry standard</a>, facilitate real-time metric calculations, and foster cross-team collaboration.

            To accelerate our concept-to-insight-to-decision cycles, I incorporated rapid code-based prototyping methods leveraging traditional approaches (React + Netlify) and novel GenAI tools (Vercel v0, Figma Make).

         <h3>The Solution</h3>
         <p>
            SDP helps study sponsors design superior clinical trials with greater speed, confidence, and precision while facilitating seamless collaboration across ClinDev, ClinOps, and other SME teams. Featuring powerful design tools, including Schedule of Activities, Eligibility Criteria Selector, and Study Schema Builder, it equips teams with tools to digitise study designs from inception.
         </p>
         <p>
            Digital-first design provides immediate access to predictive metrics from low-input estimates for early concepts to precise calculations of cost, recruitment timeline, patient burden, and carbon emissions based on complete protocols.
         </p>
         <p>
            These insights help ClinDev and ClinOps users make informed decisions about study design, feasibility, and optimisation before costs get locked in by regulatory submissions.
         </p>

         <h3>The Result</h3>
         <p>
            The top-10 pharma SDP pilot launched in spring 2025 to excellent reviews. AstraZeneca's summer SDP pilot achieved CSAT score of 80 and UMUX-Lite of 63.5, demonstrating potential to set a new standard in the trial tech space (<a href="/case-studies/merlin">Merlin's</a> CSAT ceiling was 23).
         </p>
         <p>
            SDP created a new revenue stream for Evinova, as pharma companies seek optimisation solutions amid 2025's challenging landscape of regulatory changes, tariffs, and pressure for efficient, de-risked investments.
