            <i>Please help me help my patients!</i>
         </p>
         <p>
            This plea from Barcelona's Sant Joan de Déu pediatric clinical trial team in summer 2024 crystallised a global crisis: clinical trials are drowning in complexity. <a href="https://f.hubspotusercontent10.net/hubfs/9468915/TuftsCSDD_June2021/pdf/Rising+Protocol+Design+Complexity+is+Driving+Rapid+Growth+in+Clinical+Trial+Data+Volume++++++++++.pdf">Tufts research</a> revealed a staggering increase in the number of procedures per study and per patient, which puts even more burden on patients and sites.
         </p>
         <p>
            Why does this matter and what can be done about it?
         </p>
         <h3>The Root Cause</h3>
         <p>
            Our research has shown that trial designs suffers from unverified assumptions, copy-pasting from old protocols, decision-making insulated from patient voice, and gated governance processes. 
         </p>

               The way pharma companies set up their teams and run the study design process exacerbates the problem.

            Clinical development (ClinDev) and clinical operations (ClinOps) tams rarely collaborate during the critical early stages of study creation when design choices impact study complexity and feasibility the most, and when cost of modifications is still low.

            Clinical development (ClinDev) and clinical operations (ClinOps) tams rarely collaborate during the critical early stages of study creation when design choices impact study complexity and feasibility the most, and when cost of modifications is still low.
         </p>
         <p>
            So why care? Firstly, more demanding and burdensome trials mean fewer patients can benefit from new treatments, and those who have no choice are faced with a daunting experience. Secondly, over-complex trials are harder to run, more expensive, and riskier with delays and higher drop-out rates — and this means longer waits and higher cost of new medicines for us all.
         </p>

         <h3>The Challenge</h3>
         <p>
            Create a win-win-win solution — better access and reduced burden for patients, simplified workflows for sites, and faster, cheaper trials for sponsors.
         </p>
         <h3>The Opportunity</h3>
         <p>
            Build tools that quantify complexity, burden, and cost at concept stage when changes are still feasible, enabling clindev-clinops collaboration before protocols and budgets lock in.
         </p>
         <p>
            A classic 0-to-1 challenge: launch within a year to early adopters with versatility across pharma processes, flexibility for multiple study types, and usability that appeals to actual users, not just corporate buyers.
         </p>
         <h3>My Approach</h3>
         <p>
            As part of the cross-functional product leadership team, I shaped strategy, directed design and delivery, and measured success of our new software product: Study Design and Planning (SDP).
         </p>
         <p>
            We began with a team sprint to capture SDP's vision through storyboards and speculative screens, crucial for internal alignment and external communication.

               I ran a 2-week market research exercise, interviewing 9 clinical ops leaders from top-20 pharma companies. I validated our assumptions about market need, value proposition, and critical features using our storyboard materials.

            With validation secured, I directed the team through 3 months of iterative design and continuous testing: 8 rounds of research with 40+ ClinOps and ClinDev users. Key pilot features like Schedule of Activities, Study Metrics, and Collaboration launched within 6 months.
         </p>
         <p>
            Key insights::
         </p>
         <ul>
            <li>Leverage industry conventions rather than reinventing established workflows
            </li>
            <li>True transformation in enterprise pharma comes from streamlining decision-making and reducing wait times between decision points, not saving clicks</li>
            <li>Quality trumps quantity: one excellent tool beats multiple average ones</li>
         </ul>
         <p>
            To accelerate our team's concept-to-insight cycles, I incorporated rapid prototyping methods combining traditional tools (React + Netlify) with novel GenAI approached (Vercel's v0, Figma Make).

         <h3>The Solution</h3>
         <p>
            SDP helps study sponsors design superior clinical trials with greater speed, confidence, and precision while facilitating seamless collaboration across ClinDev, ClinOps, and other SME teams. Featuring powerful design tools, including Schedule of Activities, Eligibility Criteria Selector, and Study Schema Builder, it equips teams with tools to digitise study designs from inception.
         </p>
         <p>
            Digital-first design provides immediate access to predictive metrics from low-input estimates for early concepts to precise calculations of cost, recruitment timeline, patient burden, and carbon emissions based on complete protocols.
         </p>
         <p>
            These insights help ClinDev and ClinOps users make informed decisions about study design, feasibility, and optimisation before costs get locked in by regulatory submissions.
         </p>

         <h3>The Result</h3>
         <p>
            The top-10 pharma SDP pilot launched in spring 2025 to excellent reviews. AstraZeneca's summer SDP pilot achieved CSAT score of 80 and UMUX-Lite of 63.5, demonstrating potential to set a new standard in the trial tech space (<a href="/case-studies/merlin">Merlin's</a> CSAT ceiling was 23).
         </p>
         <p>
            SDP created a new revenue stream for Evinova, as pharma companies seek optimisation solutions amid 2025's challenging landscape of regulatory changes, tariffs, and pressure for efficient, de-risked investments.
