            <i>— Please help me help my patients!</i>
         </p>
         <p>
            This plea from Barcelona's Sant Joan de Déu pediatric trial site team in summer 2024 crystallised a global crisis: clinical trials are drowning in complexity. <a href="https://f.hubspotusercontent10.net/hubfs/9468915/TuftsCSDD_June2021/pdf/Rising+Protocol+Design+Complexity+is+Driving+Rapid+Growth+in+Clinical+Trial+Data+Volume++++++++++.pdf">Tufts research</a> revealed a staggering increase in the number of procedures per trial and patient, which puts unreasonable burden on patients and sites, stifling drug R&D.
         </p>
         <p>
            In 2024, I set out with my Evinova team to tackle this crisis.
         </p>

         <h3>Change how pharma works to reduce complexity</h3>
         <p>
            Trial designs suffer from unverified assumptions, closed-door decisions insulating sponsors from patient experience, inefficient governance processes, and copy-pasting from old protocols.
         </p>
         <p>
            Case in point: a paediatric clinical trial asking 8-year-olds about their use of alcohol and contraception — thoughtlessly copied from adult protocols.
         </p>
         <p>
            The core issue is how big pharma work. Clinical development (ClinDev) and clinical operations (ClinOps) teams rely on limited data for decision-making and rarely collaborate during the earliest stages of study creation — critical for controlling study complexity and feasibility when the cost of protocol changes is still low.
         </p>

            So what?
         </p>
         <p>
            Burdensome trials mean fewer patients can benefit from new treatment options. And those with no choice are forced through a heavy experience. Over-complex trials are hard to run, expensive, and risky due to delays and high drop-out rates. This means longer waits and higher cost of new medicines for all of us — and ultimately fewer lives saved.
         </p>
         <h3>A new solution to create better trials</h3>
          <p>
            We need simpler and more effective clinical trials that deliver better outcomes for patients, sites, sponsors and society. We can get there by helping sponsors optimise trial design early on.
         </p>
         <p>
            AstraZeneca launched Evinova to address this. Earlier, I helped AZ build <a href="/case-studies/merlin">Merlin</a> — a precursor to solving this problem — but it was not market-ready due to tech debt and AZ-specific customisation.
         </p>
         <p>
            So it became a classic 0-to-1 challenge: launch within a year with a value proposition fostering ClinDev-ClinOps collaboration and early-stage holistic optimisation to reduce protocol complexity, while detaching from a global corporation and driving AI adoption.
         </p>
         <h3>Leading with design through messy reality</h3>
         <p>
            As part of the cross-functional product leadership team, I shaped our strategy, directed design and delivery, and measured the success of our new solution.
         </p>
         <p>
            My approach to designing the new solution was evidence-based, design-led, and iteration-driven, leveraging emerging AI tools. I began by formulating product vision using situational storyboards and speculative product screens for internal alignment and external communication. 
         </p>

            Through our research, we learnt that:
         </p>
         <ul>
            <li>Sponsor teams want to reduce protocol complexity but they need a reliable way to measure it.</li>
            <li>ClinDev teams copy-paste parts of old protocols to reduce regulatory risk, not to save time drafting.</li>
            <li>The success of ClinDev-ClinOps collaboration tools depend on upstream adoption; to buy in, ClinDevs must get immediate personal value (e.g. patient burden metrics, company-vetted templates, endpoint-assessment linking).</li>
            <li>Sponsors can gain efficiency by reducing 'white space' — the no-work and no-decision time between protocol drafting and reviews, and governance interactions (e.g. a month-long wait for protocol review by the next Design Review Committee).</li>

            These insights shaped our strategy. I led design and development of key elements of a digital study protocol: Schedule of Activities (SoA), Eligibility Criteria, Study Schema, Objectives and Endpoints. Together, these enable structured study design aligned to <a href="https://www.cdisc.org/ddf">industry standards</a>, real-time metrics, and cross-team collaboration.

            To accelerate our concept-to-insight cycles, I brought in rapid prototyping (React + Netlify) and vibe-coding (v0 and Figma Make) into my team's UX tookit. This gave us access to faster and more robust user-derived insights.

         <h3>Study Design and Planning</h3>
         <p>
            Study Design and Planning (SDP) to facilitate ClinDev-ClinOps collaboration in early stages of study design when optimisation costs least. Our value proposition addresses combined ClinDev and ClinOps needs with key digital protocol tools aiming to win upstream adoption by ClinDev.
         </p>
         <p>
            Patient experience metrics and endpoint-assessment linking help ClinDevs design patient-centric studies with only as few on-site activities as necessary, while pre-vetted templates remove the need to copy-paste. For ClinOps, real-time cost and complexity metrics help optimise study design before changes lock in.
         </p>
         <p>
            Future SDP versions will deploy AI agents for protocol reviews to maximise iteration between governance points and reduce 'white space', driving down cost, risk of amendments, and complexity.
         </p>
         <p>
            Through comprehensive in-the-moment metrics and cross-functional collaboration, SDP gives pharma sponsors powerful tools to measure and reduce clinical trial complexity.
         </p>


         <h3>A win for everyone</h3>
         <p>
            We launched SDP as a pilot in spring 2025 to a top-10 pharma early adopter and immediately collected excellent reviews.
         </p>
         <p>
            AstraZeneca's summer pilot achieved CSAT of 80 and UMUX-Lite of 63.5, setting new standards in trial tech (<a href="/case-studies/merlin">Merlin's</a> CSAT ceiling: 23).
         </p>
         <p>
           SDP created new revenue streams as pharma seeks optimisation amid 2025's challenging regulatory, trade, and tech landscapes.
         </p>
         <p>
            By autumn 2025, SDP gained multi-pharma traction, started delivering on its promise of complexity reduction, and was becoming the AI-first trial design leader.
