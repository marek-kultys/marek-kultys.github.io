            <i>— Please help me help my patients!</i>
         </p>
         <p>
            This plea from Barcelona's Sant Joan de Déu pediatric clinical trial team in summer 2024 crystallised a global crisis: clinical trials are drowning in complexity. <a href="https://f.hubspotusercontent10.net/hubfs/9468915/TuftsCSDD_June2021/pdf/Rising+Protocol+Design+Complexity+is+Driving+Rapid+Growth+in+Clinical+Trial+Data+Volume++++++++++.pdf">Tufts research</a> revealed a staggering increase in the number of procedures per study and per patient, which puts even more burden on patients and sites.
         </p>
         <p>
            Why does this matter and what can be done about it?
         </p>
         <h3>The Root Cause</h3>
         <p>
            Our research has shown that trial designs suffers from unverified assumptions, decision-making insulated from patient voice, gated governance processes, and copy-pasting from old protocols. 
         </p>
         <p>
            We heard about a study recruiting 8-year-olds with questionnaires about the use of alcohol and contraception — thoughtlessly copied from another protocol.
         </p>
      </div>

            <h4 class="caption">
               The way pharma companies set up their study teams and run the study design process exacerbates the problem.
            </h4>
            <h4 class="caption">
               Teams rely on structured handoffs. This kills collaboration which is critical for holistic early-stage optimisation.
            </h4>
         </div>
      </div>


      <div class="container-two-thirds shift">
         <p>
            Besides that, clinical development (ClinDev) and clinical operations (ClinOps) teams rarely collaborate during the critical early stages of study creation when design choices impact study complexity and feasibility the most, and when the cost to modify is still low.
         </p>
         <p>
            So why care?
         </p>
         <p>
            Firstly, more demanding and burdening trials mean fewer patients can benefit from new treatments — and those who have no choice are faced with a daunting experience. Secondly, over-complex trials are harder to run, more expensive and riskier due to delays and higher drop-out rates — and this means longer waits, higher cost of medicines for all of us, and ultimately fewer lives saved.
         </p>
         <h3>The Challenge</h3>
          <p>
            We need clinical trials that are simpler, more effective, and deliver better outcomes for patients, sites, sponsors, and society. And we know we can get there by helping study teams design trials from the outset, while holistic optimisation is possible and worthwhile.
         </p>
         <p>
            AstraZeneca launched its health-tech company, Evinova, on a mission to address this challenge. Earlier, I helped build <a href="/case-studies/merlin">Merlin</a> — AZ's precursor to solving this problem — but it was not market-ready due to high levels of tech debt and tailoring to AZ.
         </p>
         <p>
            So it became a classic 0-to-1 challenge: develop a new product and launch to early adopters within a year. Build a value proposition for both ClinDev and ClinOps users that will foster collaboration and holistic optimisation in the early stages of the clinical study design process. And do it all while detatching from a global corporation, facilitating multiple team reorgs, and driving AI adoption. 
         </p>
         <h3>My Approach</h3>
         <p>
            As part of the cross-functional product leadership team, I shaped strategy, directed design and delivery, and measured success of Evinova's new digital product: Study Design and Planning (SDP).

               I began by capturing SDP vision using storyboards and speculative screens for internal alignment and external communication.

         <p>
            Using the storyboards as stimulus, I ran a 2-week market research exercise, interviewing 9 ClinOps leaders from top-20 pharma companies. I validated our value proposition focusing on enabling cross-functional collaboration and early-stage optimisation. 
         </p>
         <p>
            With more confidence in our product bet, I directed the team through 3 months of iterative design and continuous testing: 8 rounds of research with 40+ ClinOps and ClinDev users. Key pilot features like Schedule of Activities, Collaboration, and Study Metrics launched within 6 months.
         </p>
         <p>
            Key insights:
         </p>
         <ul>
            <li>Leverage industry conventions rather than reinventing established workflows
            </li>
            <li>True transformation in enterprise pharma comes from streamlining decision-making and reducing wait times between decision points, not saving clicks</li>
            <li>Quality trumps quantity: one excellent tool beats multiple average ones</li>
         </ul>
         <p>
            To accelerate our team's concept-to-insight cycles, I incorporated rapid prototyping methods combining traditional tools (React + Netlify) with novel GenAI approached (Vercel's v0, Figma Make). Here's <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/marek-kultys_i-used-genai-to-accelerate-time-to-insight-activity-7333522030786437120-JDs3?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAAPT12oBw9huIJSVosm9nXB9UKoQ5YOJPfI"></a>my LinkedIn post</a> with GenAI evaluation.

         <h3>The Solution</h3>
         <p>
            SDP helps study sponsors design superior clinical trials with greater speed, confidence, and precision while facilitating seamless collaboration across ClinDev, ClinOps, and other SME teams. Featuring powerful design tools, including Schedule of Activities, Eligibility Criteria Selector, and Study Schema Builder, it equips teams with tools to digitise study designs from inception.
         </p>
         <p>
            Digital-first design provides immediate access to predictive metrics from low-input estimates for early concepts to precise calculations of cost, recruitment timeline, patient burden, and carbon emissions based on complete protocols.
         </p>
         <p>
            These insights help ClinDev and ClinOps users make informed decisions about study design, feasibility, and optimisation before costs get locked in by regulatory submissions.
         </p>

         <h3>The Result</h3>
         <p>
            The top-10 pharma SDP pilot launched in spring 2025 to excellent reviews. AstraZeneca's summer SDP pilot achieved CSAT score of 80 and UMUX-Lite of 63.5, demonstrating potential to set a new standard in the trial tech space (<a href="/case-studies/merlin">Merlin's</a> CSAT ceiling was 23).
         </p>
         <p>
            SDP created a new revenue stream for Evinova, as pharma companies seek optimisation solutions amid 2025's challenging landscape of regulatory changes, tariffs, and pressure for efficient, de-risked investments.
