            I heard this plea from the paediatric clinical trial site team at the Sant Joan de Déu hospital in Barcelona in summer 2024.

            How can we reverse this trend? How can we improve access to life-saving medicine and effectiveness of clinical trials?

         <h3>The Challenge</h3>
         <p>
            When AstraZeneca launched Evinova to commercialise their digital health R&D portfolio, the existing <a href="/case-studies/merlin">Merlin</a> platform wasn't market-ready due to significant tech debt and heavy customisation for AZ's governance processes.
         </p>
         <p>
            Research revealed Merlin focused on study optimisation too late in the process — after design decisions and costs were locked in. We needed to shift focus to early-stage study design for maximum impact. 
            <!-- Our insight told us this must involve expanding to more user types beyond clinops to clindev . -->
            <!-- define who clindev and clinops are, and establish shorthands -->
         </p>
         <p>
            A classic 0-to-1 challenge: launch within a year to early adopters. The product needed versatility across pharma processes, flexibility for multiple study types, and usability that appeals to actual users, not just corporate buyers.
         </p>
         <h3>My Approach</h3>
         <p>
            As part of the cross-functional product leadership team, I shaped strategy, directed design and delivery, and measured success of our new software product: Study Design and Planning (SDP).
         </p>
         <p>
            We began with a team sprint to capture SDP's vision through storyboards and speculative screens, crucial for internal alignment and external communication.

               I ran a 2-week market research exercise, interviewing 9 clinical ops leaders from top-20 pharma companies. I validated our assumptions about market need, value proposition, and critical features using our storyboard materials.

            With validation secured, I directed the team through 3 months of iterative design and continuous testing: 8 rounds of research with 40+ ClinOps and ClinDev users. Key pilot features like Schedule of Activities, Study Metrics, and Collaboration launched within 6 months.
         </p>
         <p>
            Key insights::
         </p>
         <ul>
            <li>Leverage industry conventions rather than reinventing established workflows
            </li>
            <li>True transformation in enterprise pharma comes from streamlining decision-making and reducing wait times between decision points, not saving clicks</li>
            <li>Quality trumps quantity: one excellent tool beats multiple average ones</li>
         </ul>
         <p>
            To accelerate our team's concept-to-insight cycles, I incorporated rapid prototyping methods combining traditional tools (React + Netlify) with novel GenAI approached (Vercel's v0, Figma Make). Here's <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/marek-kultys_i-used-genai-to-accelerate-time-to-insight-activity-7333522030786437120-JDs3?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAAPT12oBw9huIJSVosm9nXB9UKoQ5YOJPfI"></a>my LinkedIn post</a> with GenAI evaluation.

         <h3>The Solution</h3>
         <p>
            SDP helps study sponsors design superior clinical trials with greater speed, confidence, and precision while facilitating seamless collaboration across ClinDev, ClinOps, and other SME teams. Featuring powerful design tools, including Schedule of Activities, Eligibility Criteria Selector, and Study Schema Builder, it equips teams with tools to digitise study designs from inception.
         </p>
         <p>
            Digital-first design provides immediate access to predictive metrics from low-input estimates for early concepts to precise calculations of cost, recruitment timeline, patient burden, and carbon emissions based on complete protocols.
         </p>
         <p>
            These insights help ClinDev and ClinOps users make informed decisions about study design, feasibility, and optimisation before costs get locked in by regulatory submissions.
         </p>

         <h3>The Result</h3>
         <p>
            The top-10 pharma SDP pilot launched in spring 2025 to excellent reviews. AstraZeneca's summer SDP pilot achieved CSAT score of 80 and UMUX-Lite of 63.5, demonstrating potential to set a new standard in the trial tech space (<a href="/case-studies/merlin">Merlin's</a> CSAT ceiling was 23).
         </p>
         <p>
            SDP created a new revenue stream for Evinova, as pharma companies seek optimisation solutions amid 2025's challenging landscape of regulatory changes, tariffs, and pressure for efficient, de-risked investments.
