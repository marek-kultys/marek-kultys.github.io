         <h3>The Challenge</h3>
         <p>
            Bioinformatics is the cornerstone of modern life sciences. However, some of its early tools still struggle to provide answers to the problems investigated by modern researchers.
         </p>
         <p>
            Popular tools for Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSAs) visualisation and analysis (such as <a href="https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/18/20/6097/1141316" target="_blank">Sequence Logo</a> or <a href="https://plogo.uconn.edu/" target="_blank">pLogo)</a> hide relational patterns in sequence data by aggregating information on a position-by-position basis. This means important dependencies and correlations between neighbouring positions or far-away locations are lost.
         </p>
      </div>

               pLogo summarises data about each position in a sequence but hides important information about the sequence itself.
            </h4>
            <h4 class="caption">
               Here, two different sequences result in the same pLogo. We need new tools to expose sequential patterns in data.

            How might we visualise sequence data differently to expose relational patterns in data and help scientists better understand biology, debug datasets, and drive scientific discovery further?
         </p>

         <h3>My Approach</h3>
         <p>
            My user-centred approach focused on target audiences in academia and industry. It helped secure interest from bioinformatics practitioners. I invited users to co-design, I prototyped, tested, and took the concept to conferences.

            In 2014, I initiated a partnership between Science Practice and the <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/research/goldman/" target="_blank">Goldman Group</a> at the EMBL-EBI to develop Sequence Bundles as a software tool. Our work was funded by a £33,000 InnovateUK grant that I secured.
         </p>
         <p>
            I managed the project, led design work, supervised software development, contributed front-end code, and oversaw launch to the scientific community.
         </p>

         <h3>The Solution</h3>
         <p>
            Sequence Bundles is a novel MSA visualisation tool that exposes patterns in sequence data that would otherwise remain hidden. By preserving sequence continuity, the method provides meaningful visualisation that makes it possible to observe important residue correlations and uncover hidden sequence motifs.

            Sequence Bundles was launched as a visualisation engine in combination with other bioinformatics analysis tools in a desktop app called Alvis, and as a quick-access <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/goldman-srv/sequencebundles/" target="_blank">web app</a> online.

         <h3>The Result</h3>
         <p>
            Sequence Bundles was published in peer-reviewed journals and won industry recognition.
         </p>
         <p>
            To date, it received 27 academic citations, praise from bioinformatics practitioners, and industry awards including <a href="https://www.informationisbeautifulawards.com/showcase/1282-sequence-bundles" target="_blank">shortlist</a> for the Kantar Information is Beautiful Awards 2016.
         </p>
         <p>
            Sequence Bundles was a self-initiated science innovation project, funded by myself, Science Practice, and the InnovateUK grant.
