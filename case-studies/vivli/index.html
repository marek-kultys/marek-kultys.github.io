            <h3>The Challenge</h3>
            <p>
               Vivli is a global non-profit on a mission to maximise the use and access to clinical trial data for the benefit of the wider biomedical R&D community.
            </p>
            <p>
               In 2016, Vivli approached with technical specs of their new data sharing platform. They needed help with two key challenges holding up their progress:
            </p>
            <ul>
               <li>Validate Vivli’s vision with target users</li>
               <li>Get Vivli’s consortium of partners behind this vision</li>
            </ul>
      </div>

               We used concept modeling, sketching, and process design to shape the user experience and information architecture of Vivli's new data sharing platform.

      </div>

      <div class="container-two-thirds shift">
         <h3>My Approach</h3>
         <p>
            To address both challenged, I worked with Vivli founders to translate their technical specification into a tangible design proposal delivered as a clickable prototype.
         </p>
         <p>
            I then used the prototype to validate the product and communicate its vision and value to stakeholders.
         </p>
      </div>

               Through prototyping, I showcased the experience for two types of Vivli users: Data Submitters and Data Requesters.
            </h4>
            <h4 class="caption">
               A narrated demo showing how the platform delivers value to both groups won the hearts of Vivli's stakeholders.

      <div class="container-two-thirds shift">
         <h3>The Result</h3>
         <p>
            I validated Vivli's vision in research with experts. I used the prototype as design stimulus in conversation to help elicit feedback and action it in subsequent iterations.
         </p>
         <p>
            With the prototype, I produced a video demo showing Vivli’s vision in tangible, realistic terms. It helped Vivli founders impress their partners and win their support.
