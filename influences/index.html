               Throughout my design career I've worked across many different subject domains: from the life sciences, to healthcare, to diagnostics, to AI. While it was always very important for me to climb the learning curve in each of those areas, it was also the designer's <i>magic sauce</i> that always made my contribution valuable.
            </p>
            <p>
               Here's the list of ingredients for my <i>magic sacuse</i>:

            <h3><a href="https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_vdqi" target="_blank">Edward Tufte</a></h3>
            <p>Reading Tufte's <a href="https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_vdqi" target="_blank">The Visual Display of Quantitative Information</a> shaped the way I approach and think about visual information. Although strongly rooted in the print medium, most of Tufte's observations still apply to the digital context.</p>

            <h3><a href="https://www.gv.com/sprint/" target="_blank">Design Sprint</a></h3>
            <p>I wish I had this book when I was a student! Today, whenever I visit my home country (Poland) to teach a design class at an arts college, I donate a copy of Design Sprint to their library so that new design students can read it early on.</p>

            <h3><a href="http://www.eyemagazine.com/feature/article/reputations-adrian-frutiger" target="_blank">Adrian Frutiger</a></h3>
            <p>I read <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mensch-seine-Zeichen-Adrian-Frutiger/dp/3937715630" target="_blank">Der Mensch und Seine Zeichen</a> in Polish (sadly, no English translation). Frutiger's deconstruction of the visual language underpins most of my design work to this day and his list of visual primitives is pretty much a design system for writing.</p>

            <h3><a href="https://www.science-practice.com/" target="_blank">James King and Science Practice</a></h3>
            <p>I've been lucky to have James as a friend and a mentor since 2011 when I started working with him at Science Practice. For almost 8 years I've been able to grow beside him as a designer and a leader, learning how to apply a design mindset to <a href="https://www.science-practice.com/projects/longitude/" target="_blank">so many</a> <a href="https://www.science-practice.com/blog/2017/06/06/minion-soil-metagenomics-experiment/" target="_blank">diverse</a> <a href="https://www.ctrl-group.com/case-studies/vivli" target="_blank">challenges</a> <a href="https://www.cognitionkit.com/" target="_blank">and domains</a>.</p>

            <h3><a href="https://www.bookdepository.com/Understanding-Comics-Scott-McCloud/9780060976255" target="_blank">Understanding Comics</a></h3>
            <p>I recommend reading McCloud's book to anyone interested in visual communication. Two things that made a lasting impact on me are McCloud's explanations of image transisions and the "reality—meaning—abstraction" pyramid.</p>

            <h3>Bauhaus, Gestalt, and Ergonomics</h3>
            <p>My first design training was in industrial design. I made and built things, and got dirty on occasions. I've been shaped by the modernist concept of <i>form follows function</i>, the paradigms of human-centred design, and the idealistic drive of <i>design for all</i>.</p>
