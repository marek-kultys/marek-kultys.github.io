               I've been inspired by these people and their work:

            <h3>Edward Tufte</h3>
            <p>Reading Tufte's <a href="https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_vdqi" target="_blank">The Visual Display of Quantitative Information</a> shaped the way I approach and think about visual information. Although strongly rooted in the print medium, most of Tufte's observations still apply to the digital context.</p>

            <h3>Isotype</h3>
            <p>Isotype's visual style, ingenious charts, and clever narratives have always been an inspiration for me in my work with data. But only after reading <a href="https://hyphenpress.co.uk/products/books/978-0-907259-40-4" target="_blank">The Transformer</a>, I also appreciated the value of the process that Otto and Marie Neurath established to distill something complex into something playful.</p>

            <h3>James King and Science Practice</h3>
            <p>I've been lucky to have James as a friend and a mentor since 2011 when I started working with him at <a href="https://www.science-practice.com/" target="_blank">Science Practice</a>. For almost 8 years I've been able to grow beside him as a designer and a leader, learning how to apply a design mindset to so many challenges and domains.</p>

            <h3>Medium</h3>
            <p>For me — when it comes to articles about product design, UX, and design leadership — the best thing about <a href="https://medium.com/@marekkultys" target="_blank">Medium</a> is the diversity of opinion. My favourite authors include:
            <a href="https://medium.com/@intercom" target="_blank">Intercom</a>,
            <a href="https://medium.com/@nikki_anderson" target="_blank">Nikki Anderson</a>,
            <a href="https://medium.com/@ilikescience" target="_blank">Matt Ström</a>,
            <a href="https://ux.shopify.com/@matt.griffin" target="_blank">Matt Griffin</a>,
            <a href="https://medium.com/@kozyrkov" target="_blank">Cassie Kozyrkov</a>,
            <a href="https://medium.com/@buster" target="_blank">Buster Benson</a>,
            <a href="https://medium.com/@seagertp" traget="_blank">Thomas P Seager</a>, and the
            <a href="https://medium.com/@cziscience" target="_blank">Chan Zuckerberg Science Initiative</a>.</p>

            <h3>Jake Knapp and John Zeratsky</h3>
            <p>I wish I had Jake's <a href="https://www.gv.com/sprint/#book" target="_blank">Design Sprint</a> book when I was a student! Today, whenever I visit my home country to teach a design class at an arts college, I donate a copy of Design Sprint to their library so that new design students can have access to it early on.</p>
            <p>Currently, I'm reading their second book: <a href="https://maketime.blog/">Make Time</a>.</p>

            <h3>Adrian Frutiger</h3>
            <p>I read <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mensch-seine-Zeichen-Adrian-Frutiger/dp/3937715630" target="_blank">Der Mensch und Seine Zeichen</a> in Polish (sadly, no English translation). Frutiger's analysis of the visual language (including typography, iconography, and layout) inspires most of my design work to this day.</p>
         </div>
         <div class="entry">
            <h3>Scott McCloud</h3>
            <p>I recommend reading <a href="https://www.bookdepository.com/Understanding-Comics-Scott-McCloud/9780060976255" target="_blank">Understanding Comics</a> to anyone interested in visual communication. Two things that made a lasting impact on me are McCloud's explanations of image transitions and the "reality—meaning—abstraction" pyramid.</p>

         <div class="entry">
            <h3>Kevin M. Hoffman</h3>
            <p>I discovered Kevin's <a href="https://rosenfeldmedia.com/books/meeting-design/" target="_blank">Meeting Design</a> book slightly by accident through a <a href="https://uxpodcast.com/183-meeting-design-kevin-hoffman/" target="_blank">podcast</a>. Although most of Kevin's book is common sense, often things need to be written down to carry the message across and help develop new habits.</p>

            <h3>R. D. Sinelnikov</h3>
            <p>I grew up in a family of medical doctors, surrounded by medial handbooks from the earliest years of my life. There was one book in particular that I loved browsing and that for me for the first time brought together the concepts of the life sciences and arts: Sinelnikov's Atlas of Human Anatomy.</p>
