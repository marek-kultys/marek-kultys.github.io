            <p>
               I've been inspired by these people and their work:
            </p>
         </div>
         <div class="entry">
            <h3>Edward Tufte</h3>
            <p>Reading Tufte's <a href="https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_vdqi" target="_blank">The Visual Display of Quantitative Information</a> shaped the way I approach and think about visual information. Although strongly rooted in the print medium, most of Tufte's observations still apply to the digital context.</p>
         </div>
         <div class="entry">
            <h3>Jake Knapp</h3>
            <p>I wish I had Jake's <a href="https://www.gv.com/sprint/#book" target="_blank">Design Sprint</a> book when I was a student! Today, whenever I visit my home country to teach a design class at an arts college, I donate a copy of Design Sprint to their library so that new design students can have access to it early on.</p>
            <p>Currently, I'm reading Jake's second book: <a href="https://maketime.blog/">Make Time</a>.</p>
         </div>
         <div class="entry">
            <h3>Adrian Frutiger</h3>
            <p>I read <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mensch-seine-Zeichen-Adrian-Frutiger/dp/3937715630" target="_blank">Der Mensch und Seine Zeichen</a> in Polish (sadly, no English translation). Frutiger's deconstruction of the visual language (including scripts) inspires most of my design work to this day.</p>
         </div>
         <div class="entry">
            <h3>James King and Science Practice</h3>
            <p>I've been lucky to have James as a friend and a mentor since 2011 when I started working with him at <a href="https://www.science-practice.com/" target="_blank">Science Practice</a>. For almost 8 years I've been able to grow beside him as a designer and a leader, learning how to apply a design mindset to so many challenges and domains.</p>
         </div>
         <div class="entry">
            <h3>Scott McCloud</h3>
            <p>I recommend reading <a href="https://www.bookdepository.com/Understanding-Comics-Scott-McCloud/9780060976255" target="_blank">Understanding Comics</a> to anyone interested in visual communication. Two things that made a lasting impact on me are McCloud's explanations of image transisions and the "reality—meaning—abstraction" pyramid.</p>
         </div>
         <div class="entry">
            <h3>Kevin M. Hoffman</h3>
            <p>I discovered Kevin's <a href="https://rosenfeldmedia.com/books/meeting-design/" target="_blank">Meeting Design</a> book slightly by accident through a <a href="https://uxpodcast.com/183-meeting-design-kevin-hoffman/" target="_blank">podcast</a>. Although most of Kevin's book is just common sense, often things need to be written down to carry the message across and help develop new habits.</p>
         </div>
         <div class="entry">
            <h3>R. D. Sinelnikov</h3>
            <p>I grew up in a family of medical doctors, surrounded by medial handbooks from the earliest years of my life. There was one book in particular that I loved browsing and that for me for the first time brought together the concepts of the life sciences and arts: Sinelnikov's Atlas of Human Anatomy.</p>
