               I've been inspired by these people and their work:

            <h3>Radical Candor</h3>
            <p>I revisit Kim Scott's <a href="https://www.radicalcandor.com/the-book/" target="_blank">Radical Candor</a> regularly to re-align my compass on things that are important to me in being a UX leader. Kim's advice to care personally and challenge directly (illustrated by vivid anegdotes from her own career in tech companies) has shaped my approach to leadership and management.</p>

            <h3>Isotype</h3>
            <p>Isotype's visual style, ingenious charts, and clever narratives have always been an inspiration for me in my work with data. But only after reading <a href="https://hyphenpress.co.uk/products/books/978-0-907259-40-4" target="_blank">The Transformer</a>, I also appreciated the value of the process that Otto and Marie Neurath established to distill something complex into something playful.</p>

            <h3>James King and Science Practice</h3>
            <p>I've been lucky to have James as a friend and a mentor since 2011 when I started working with him at <a href="https://www.science-practice.com/" target="_blank">Science Practice</a>. For almost 8 years I've been able to grow beside him as a designer and a leader, learning to apply a design mindset to various domains.</p>

            <h3>Adrian Frutiger</h3>
            <p>I read <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mensch-seine-Zeichen-Adrian-Frutiger/dp/3937715630" target="_blank">Der Mensch und Seine Zeichen</a> in Polish (sadly, no English translation). Frutiger's analysis of the visual language — including typography, iconography, and layout — inspires most of my design work to this day.</p>

            <h3>Theory of Vision</h3>
            <p>In his groundbreaking <a href="https://post.moma.org/wladyslaw-strzeminskis-theory-of-vision/" target="_blank">Theory of Vision</a>, Władysław Strzemiński described the evolution of human vision not only as a sensory apparatus, but also as one of our cognitive faculties. Strzemiński's expanded definition of what it means to 'see' and to 'reason' using visual stimuli remains a revelation for me.</p>

            <h3>Scott McCloud</h3>
            <p>I recommend reading <a href="https://www.scottmccloud.com/2-print/1-uc/index.html" target="_blank">Understanding Comics</a> to anyone interested in visual communication. Two things that made a lasting impact on me are McCloud's explanations of image transitions and the 'reality-meaning-abstraction' pyramid.</p>

            <h3>Edward Tufte</h3>
            <p>Reading Tufte's <a href="https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_vdqi" target="_blank">The Visual Display of Quantitative Information</a> shaped the way I approach and think about visual information. Although strongly rooted in the print medium, most of Tufte's observations still apply to the digital context.</p>

            <h3>R. D. Sinelnikov</h3>
            <p>I grew up in a family of medical doctors, surrounded by medial handbooks from the earliest years of my life. There was one book in particular that I loved browsing and that, for me, for the first time brought together the concepts of the life sciences and arts: Sinelnikov's <a href="https://www.scribd.com/doc/48131460/Sinelnikov-Vol-1#page=244" target="_blank">Atlas of Human Anatomy</a>.</p>
