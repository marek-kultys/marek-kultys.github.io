This is the last post from my series about communicating with extraterrestrial intelligence. In this post, I discuss my <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/277892123_Lingua_Extraterrestris" target="_blank">master's thesis</a>, which I presented at the <a href="https://communicating.seti.org/" target="_blank">Communicating Across the Cosmos</a> workshop organised by the SETI Institute.
