TL;DR
Vision prototyping is one of those tools that can be very helpful or super risky, depending on how its used and who you work with. It can be effective to communicate and sell the vision, and to get people onboard your project. But if not used wisely and carefully, it can also be the source of confusion and disappointment.
In Merlin we used to deliver vision prototypes for our product 3-year vision every year. This built anticipation and excitement, and because it was done well, it secured budgets. But we failed to deliver on the promises and started being perceived as those who "show a lot, but don't deliver". It was a challenge to counter that opinion and win new budgets to get a next chance to actually deliver.
Sometimes, as vision prototype (which looked polished and done) got shared with engineering or product leaders who assumed this was final spec for development. Clarification was difficult because I had to admit we're nowhere close being ready to build these designs.
Sometimes, the vision prototype let people to thinking that this is how much time actual design work takes. This was difficult to explain that the vision prototype cannot be sent to production, that it needs lots more work. Design was seen as slow, inefficient, and obstructive.
