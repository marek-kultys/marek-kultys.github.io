# I work with Internal (in-house) users
1. most products are for external Users, some products are for internal Users
2. at BAI, we have internal users who use the product while we're building it
3. wip versions of product's individual features are used for drug discovery campaigns
4. this implies challenges different to those you'd experience working on a product for external Users


# Challenges in working with External VS Internal users
5. with external users the challenge is recruitment: we've a large, diverse pool of users and it's difficult to get hold of them and convince them to participate
6. with internal users the challenge is different: we've users within our own organisation, maybe even working next to you, but the pool is significantly smaller (maybe just several users), less diverse, and sometimes with vested interests


# Highs and lows of working with External users and how to make it work
7. challenge: how do you maximise the success rate of sourcing most relevant feedback?
8. in the past at SP and CTRL I've used and seen various approaches:
  - from recruiting amongst friends and family (for simple app testing)
  - to hiring a specialised agency (for patient participants in a study)
  - to sourcing via social media (for specific user types or expert groups)
  - to directly approaching individuals (for specific expert names).
9. All of those approaches had their own frustrations and benefits:
  - Frustrations:
    - hard to identify and reach out to
    - difficult / costly to recruit (incentivise)
    - assumption that users would use the product in real world
  - Benefits:
    - potential to always have fresh / new opinion
    - no organisational bias (conflict of interest)
    - able to source a variety of opinions


# Highs and lows of working with Internal users and how to make it work
10. challenge: how do you maximise the quality (relevance + objectivity) of collected feedback?
11. What are the inherent Frustrations?
  - Familiarity bias — with every research or training, our users are less and less naive (unprimed / unbiased / virgin) about the product; the fact that we're reusing them for research and using them as early adopters, introduced massive doubt in the general validity of research results that is difficult to overcome
  - sample bias — limited user group means our participant sample is always small and not very diverse
  - proximity bias — our users have worked together for years, know each other very well and influence each other's work a lot, this discounts the diversity of opinion even further
  - organisational bias — our users are part of a hierarchical organisation where some are more senior than others and some are managing others, this introduces the risk of propagating an opinion of the senior management
  -
12. Currently at BAI in order to mitigate these frustrations I try to :
  - keep users as much in the dark about new features for as long as possible (often not possible because users need to be trained in using the features so that they can use them effectively and efficiently during discovery campaigns)
  - divide user group into arms with some not involved in research until later stage when fresh feedback can be of value
  - have strict interview protocols with carefully formed questions
  - test features early enough before they are used (often not possible due to the pace at which company is working)
  - as much as possible ensure there's access to external users (e.g. collaborators) who can provide fresh perspective
  - carefully select individuals based on criteria such as their background, relationship to their peers, position in thee organisation, role in the organisation, previous experience, and years in the company
