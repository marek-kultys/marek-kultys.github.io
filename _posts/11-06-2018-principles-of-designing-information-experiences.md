I co-wrote this blog post with Simon Hazelwood-Smith while working at [Science Practice](https://www.science-practice.com/). The post is a write-up from a talk we gave at several life science industry events in 2018 in which we discussed some of the key design principles we employed at our [BioDesign](https://www.science-practice.com/teams/bio-design/) team when working on client projects.
