I wrote this blog post while working at [Science Practice](https://www.science-practice.com/) as one in a series of three about communication with extraterrestrial intelligence. The series was based on my own [masters thesis](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/277892123_Lingua_Extraterrestris) and coincided with my appearance at the [Communicating Across the Cosmos](https://communicating.seti.org/) workshop organised by the [SETI Institute](https://www.seti.org/) in 2014.
