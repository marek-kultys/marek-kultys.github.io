After running the first Visual Design for Data Explorers workshop at the IEEEVis conference in 2012, I was asked to publish a write-up of my presentation in [Parsons Journal for Information Mapping](http://piim.newschool.edu/journal/). In the article I discuss selected elements and properties of the visual language which researchers and data explorers should know and use when designing new visualisations.
