            Over the past 8 years I've worked with two <a href="http://benevolent.ai">biotech</a> <a href="http://immunocore.com">unicorns</a>, and consulted for multiple health and tech companies. I designed products for clinical decision making, patient training, biomedical data sharing, and clinical trials.

            I also write about design, speak at conferences, run design workshops, and serve as a design mentor.
