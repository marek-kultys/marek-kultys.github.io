            I lead the Merlin design team in <a href="https://www.astrazeneca.com/r-d/digital-health-revolutionising-healthcare-for-patients.html" title="Digital Health R&D at AstraZeneca">AstraZeneca's Digital Health</a>. We build digital tools that help clinical trial teams design and optimise their studies to be <a href="https://www.astrazeneca.com/r-d/clinical-innovation.html" title="Clinical Innovation at AstraZeneca R&D">patient-centric</a>, cost-effective, feasible, sustainable, and more diverse.

            Previously at <a href="http://benevolent.com" title="BenevlentAI">BenevolentAI</a>, I set up the UX function and hired a stellar design team. We designed a product platform that gave scientists access to powerful AI models at scale. This helped Benevolent scientists build a diversified <a href="https://www.benevolent.com/benevolentai-drug-programmes" title="BenevolentAI Drug Programmes">drug pipeline</a>.

            Earlier, I designed a novel <a href="https://www.science-practice.com/projects/sequence-bundles/" title="Sequence Bundles visualisation for multiple sequence alignments">data visualisation method</a> for bioinformatics, a visual identity for a biotech unicorn, and concept products in genomic medicine, clinical trial <a href="https://www.ctrl-group.com/case-studies/vivli" title="Vivli: Prototyping a global platform for clinical trial data">data sharing</a>, and portable DNA research.

            I also speak at conferences, serve as a design mentor, write about UX, and bring up three little human beings.
