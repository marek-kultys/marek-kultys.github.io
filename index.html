            I currently work at <a href="http://benevolent.ai">BenevolentAI</a> where I help design tools for faster and smarter development of new medicines using AI.

         <p>
            Over the past 8 years I've worked with two <a href="http://benevolent.ai">biotech</a> <a href="http://immunocore.com">unicorns</a>, and multiple health and tech companies. I designed products for clinical decision making, patient training, citizen science, biomedial data sharing, and clinical trials.

         <p>
            Until 2018 I worked as a design lead at <a href="https://www.science-practice.com/teams/bio-design/">Science Practice</a> and <a href="https://www.ctrl-group.com/">Ctrl Group</a>. In 2014 I also led early design work for <a href="https://www.bento.bio/">Bento Lab</a>.
         </p>
         <p>
            I also write about design, give talks, run design workshops, and serve as a mentor for startup teams.
