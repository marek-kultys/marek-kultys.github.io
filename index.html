         <p>
            With design, I connect humans to tech. I build intuitive interfaces that give experts access to complex data, AI models, and analytics tools — helping users make better, faster decisions, confidently.
         </p>
         <p>
            I lead iterative product development by bringing hands-on design and strategic thinking. I put a premium on design craft, empathy, continuous learning, and dynamic collaboration across disciplines. I create conditions where great ideas emerge and evolve.
         </p>
         <p>
            I grow design teams, mentor emerging talent, and coach individuals to thrive. I've helped organisations scale scientific discovery, capture commercial opportunities, and harness AI capabilities — all through thoughtful, evidence-driven design.
         </p>
         <p>
            I believe in Tech for Good. I work with like-minded tech leaders to shape new products that deliver a positive impact on the world.
