            Currently, I lead product design work at <a href="http://benevolent.ai">BenevolentAI</a>. Here, I collaborate with science, research, and engineering teams to design faster and better ways of developing new medicines using AI and data.

            Earlier, I led a consultancy design team at <nobr><a href="https://www.science-practice.com/teams/bio-design/">Science Practice</a></nobr>, design projects in digital health and clinical studies for <nobr><a href="https://www.ctrl-group.com/">Ctrl Group</a></nobr>, and early product design work for <nobr><a href="https://www.bento.bio/">Bento Lab</a></nobr>.
         </p>
         <p>
            From time to time I also write about design, teach, run design workshops, and act as a mentor for startup accelerators. Privately, I'm a father to Lew and Kora.
