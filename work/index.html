            <p>At BenevolentAI I lead the work of our product design team. Currently, I focus on target identification — one of the key challenges in the early stage of the drug development process. We use various computational technologies, such as NLP and AI, and a series of design patterns to help drug discoverers explore and select best targets for validation.</p>
