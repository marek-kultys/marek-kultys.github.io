            In 2006 I designed a visual brand identity for a fictional sex shop. The identity is sexy, bold and juicy.

            The logo alludes to sexuality through the use of colours and typography. Colours are rich black (like leather or latex accessories used in sex games) and vibrant pink (like silicon sex toys). The focal point of the logo are letters X and O intersecting in a very unambiguous way.

         <p>
            The logo is very erotic but not osbscene, graphic, or too explicit. Sexual references are subtle. The logo is public space friendly which always was a difficult balance to find in the erotic market ;-)
