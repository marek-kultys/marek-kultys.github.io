            Lingua Extraterrestris is an exploration into the limits of communication and my <a href="/img/work/lingua-extraterrestris/Lingua-Extraterrestris_by_Marek-Kultys.pdf" title="'Lingua Extraterrestris' full manuscript">MA thesis</a>.

            I'm interested in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_with_extraterrestrial_intelligence" title="Wikipedia article about Communication with Extraterrestrial Intelligence (CETI)">CETI</a> — Communication with Extraterrestrial Intelligence — because it is the most extreme example of all communication types. My investigation looks into historical and <span class="nowrap">science-fiction</span> examples of CETI, and concludes in expanding on the seminal <a href="http://www.seti.org/drakeequation" title="Webpage explaining the Drake Equation on the SETI Institute website">Drake Equation</a>.
         </p>
         <p>
            I presented Lingua Extraterrestris at two astrobiology conferences and in a <a href="http://communicating.seti.org/" title="Communicating Across the Cosmos workshop webpage on the SETI Institute website">workshop</a> at the SETI Institute in California.

            I looked at both scientific and science-fiction examples of communicating with extraterrestrials. I wanted to understand the similarities and differences to various ways of communication that we are familiar with here on Earth.

            I also looked at how information theory can inform our understanding of the Drake Equation, which allows to estimate the number of civilisations in our Galaxy with whom we might communicate.

            I suggest to expand one of Drake's original terms <span class="nowrap">— <i>f<sub>c</sub></i> —</span> to take into account four factors that are central to information theory and linguistic models of communication: Channel, Contact, Context, and Code.

            Abstract
         </h3>
         <br>
         <p>
            With no hard evidence for the existence of extraterrestrial intelligence (ETI), communication with ETI (CETI) remains a scholarly exercise with great potential for speculation and experimentation.
         </p>
         <p>
            The purpose of this paper is to explore CETI as the most general instance of the communication process. A custom method is used to analyse both historical and fictional examples of CETI from the perspective of the theory and practice of exchanging information. This appraoch is based on decisions:
         </p>
         <p>
            <b>1.</b> To treat both scientific and fictional examples of CETI as equally informative and valid; since none of the scientific endeavours in CETI proved successful, the credibility of CETI depictions in the works of fiction is seen as equal to its credibility in the works of science;
         </p>
         <p>
            <b>2.</b> To use a hybrid communication model for investigating CETI; because none of the existing models of terrestrial communication covers the full scope of the CETI problem, a custom model is proposed that combines elements of the <span class="nowrap">Shannon-Weaver</span> and the Jakobson models of communication.
         </p>
         <p>
            As a result of this investigation, a possibility for expanding on the <i>f<sub>c</sub></i> term of the Drake equation is identified, and interpreting it through four aspects of the generalised communication process (Channel, Contact, Context, Code) suggested.
